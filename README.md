This is my personal blog.

Here you will explore how I go from a caveman-level programmer to someone who can make my own website and other cool projects :) (For details of how I learn to code, click on "My Journey" where I specifically list all resources I used and found extremely helpful!)

If you would like to connect with me on GitHub, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or Email, you can click on the "Contact" button at the top of this page to know more about me.

My first project is Aufgaben, a simple todo app inspired by the Todo List of Gordon Zhu (in his JavaScript course that has helped me develop a strong foundation of JavaScript). You can go to aufgaben.alissanguyen.dev to try it out or simply click on the "Aufgaben" button at the top of this page.

My second project is GitHub Spotter, a project inspired by Samer Buna. I took his course on Pluralsight. You can go to githubspotter.alissanguyen.dev to try it out or simply click on the "GitHub Spotter" button at the top of this page and explore.

Disclaimer: English is not my native language so pardon me if some silly grammar mistakes bother you. If you spot any, let me know by email and I'll fix it right away :p (I'll be extremely grateful if you do that!)
